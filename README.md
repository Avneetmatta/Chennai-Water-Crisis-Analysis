# Chennai-Water-Crisis-Analysis
This project examines Chennai's water crisis by analyzing historical reservoir level data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). It explores trends in water availability, seasonal variations, and potential causes of water scarcity. The insights help in understanding urban water management challenges and supporting data-driven policy decisions.

** Analysis of Chennai Water Crisis Project**
This project examines Chennai’s water crisis by analyzing historical reservoir level data. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the dataset is processed and visualized to uncover key trends in water availability.

**Key Insights:**
Trends in Water Availability: Identifies seasonal variations and long-term patterns in reservoir levels.
Impact of Monsoons: Examines how rainfall fluctuations influence water storage and whether drought years can be predicted.
Water Scarcity Indicators: Highlights critically low water levels and their correlation with Chennai’s water crisis.
Urban Water Management Challenges: Explores the growing gap between water demand and supply due to population growth, climate change, and inefficient water resource management.
Conclusion:
The analysis reveals that Chennai's water crisis is driven by inconsistent monsoon patterns, rapid urbanization, and poor water conservation strategies. The findings emphasize the need for sustainable water management policies, improved rainwater harvesting, and proactive measures to prevent future shortages. By leveraging data-driven insights, policymakers and city planners can work toward more resilient water infrastructure and long-term solutions.
